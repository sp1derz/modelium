# CD workflow disabled until Docker/K8s implementation is complete
# 
# The current architecture uses a single Python package with CLI
# that runs as a FastAPI server, not microservices.
#
# Re-enable this after implementing:
# - Docker containers for vLLM service
# - Kubernetes manifests
# - Helm charts
#
# See STATUS.md for implementation roadmap
